      "content": "Welcome back, Chloe! It's great to help you plan another trip. Tokyo in the spring is beautiful with the cherry blossoms. Given your love for wellness and mindful experiences, we could look into some unique tea ceremonies, visit quiet gardens like Shinjuku Gyoen, or even find a day trip to a temple. And of course, I'll focus on finding the best vegetarian and vegan dining for you."

      "content": "That's a very common and understandable situation when traveling with others! So, the goal is to find a restaurant that excels at two very different things: top-tier, authentic Wagyu for your partner, and equally high-quality, creative vegetarian options for you. This can be tricky in traditional Wagyu-only places, but I can look for modern or high-end fusion restaurants that cater to this exact need. Do you have a preferred area in Tokyo or a budget per person for this meal?"

    {
      "owner": "user",
      "content": "That's exactly it. Let's aim for somewhere in the Shinjuku or Shibuya area, since we'll likely be staying there. For budget, maybe around 15,000 JPY per person for dinner? I want it to be a special meal."

    {
      "owner": "agent",
      "content": "Perfect. Shinjuku and Shibuya have countless high-end dining options. So, just to confirm, I will search for restaurants in the Shinjuku or Shibuya area, with a budget of approximately 15,000 JPY per person, that have excellent reviews for *both* their Wagyu beef and their vegetarian main courses."
